133	133	1	a	I unveiled a robust plan today to protect LGBTQ+ rights and finally secure comprehensive legal protection for members of the LGBTQ+ community. The proposal would leverage executive power and call for congressional action that ensures that LGBTQ+ people have full equality and opportunity. Our plan not only includes actions to immediately reverse the Trump Administration’s discriminatory policies, but also calls for action to ensure equal treatment for LGBTQ+ individuals. Additionally, the plan prioritizes America’s role in protecting LGBTQ+ people around the globe. Full details in link.

Flashbacks from the most perfect night ⛅️ Taylor and I spent the eventing at Studios (my favorite) before waking over to the Boardwalk to grab some Ample Hills ice cream 🍦. After that we went and took some pictures inside the photo booth because it’s honestly one of my favorite things to do! I have so many strips of pictures from different fun park times with friends! Each one reminds me of a day when we would squish inside a very hot booth with no air circulation to pose like goofs 😆😅 Also there’s just something about having the pictures physically printed out 📷 (if you use your magic band, digital copies like these will also sync to your app so you can save them on your phone too!) 💓 If you haven’t done these photo booths in the parks before (or also on the Boardwalk), I HIGHLY recommend it!! .

Here’s the juicy stuff: so this past weekend, @thepixietraveler and I had breakfast at Trattoria al Forno on the Boardwalk 😋 (right around the corner from this picture! Sorry I forgot to Story it! 🙈). It’s honestly one of my FAVORITE breakfasts on property 🥚🥞 And here’s a little tip if you want to go there, but you a) aren’t interested in character dining or b) want to save some $. If you go up to the desk there, you can actually ask to sit in a small room off to the side that is separate from the rest of the dining room. The characters don’t come in that room & you can order off of a menu a la cart! So it’s MUCH cheaper!! 🎉 Also bonus is you don’t have to make a reservation for this! (Though it can get full from time to time, but I’ve honestly never had to wait too long) And the BEST part is their Iced Coffee, which is topped with whipped cream & is sooo sweet and delicious!! ☕️🤤 (the coffee is honestly my favorite part of this whole place) So there ya go!! 🙌🏻 A little insider tip on how to save some money & also have some of the best coffee of your life!! 😉😘💖"

171	171	0	a	This experience they call Fatherhood has been the greatest gift I could have ever been given. I still remember being 25 years old.. coming home from my first trip to Japan where I shot a cover story for Surfer magazine and I was buzzing with excitement. I came home to my wife @brea_face who announced by holding up a onesie .. that we were pregnant. I don’t even remember the words that came out of my mouth but I’m sure they were some type of supportive mumble. But the truth was I was scared sh*tless, trembling and more afraid then I’ve ever been. I’ve dealt with my fair share of insecurity as a young dad raising two boys.. the added pressure of not growing up with my Father made me question myself In many ways. I would say that for me personally there has been nothing that has provided more growth more healing and pride than raising these two with my amazing wife @brea_face .

Transparency is everything.... and in a concerted effort to be more transparent I have been working this year to take physical & mental stock of my toll on the environment. Which is why I am working in 2019 to create an Environmental Advocacy Document that is available to the public on my website listing the many Environmental Partners we have supported & continue to work with Including NGO’s & Social Justice groups over the last 10 years. As well as measure my carbon footprint.
This document also includes efforts made both personally & through my business that have helped define what we (my team & I) stand for. Decisions like running our entire office off of solar, being a certified Green business by the county of San Luis Obispo or personal choices like eating vegan or having a veggie garden. Every decision makes a difference, even the small ones.
I do this not for bragging rights but to hopefully set a better example of transparency in a day and age where so many of us make our living and livelihood from nature. I hope others will do the same.

My good friend and director Kellen Keene are seeking to share it all with us through their film.

Their film is almost finished and needs a final push from people that still believe in good old fashioned storytelling. Check it out at @byhandproject and learn how you can help out!"
192	192	0	a	"Our happiness is so cheap. What I mean by that is that despite the often overwhelming waves of praise we seek out we tend to focus on the one negative thing. Social media is a great example .. when you share something near and dear to your heart, possibly even opening up about something personal- instead of seeing all the good, we tend to hone in on just the negative comments or those that may not agree.. as if everyone is supposed to? This happens so often in life as well. You can go to great lengths to have a perfect day.. amazing breakfast, favorite music, exercise.. whatever - And the first person to cut you off in traffic steals your attention and your “happiness”. Just something to think about as you go about your day looking for positive, rather than negative.

Two years ago I sat with my friend Peter discussing all the issues I I found with the bulky modern day design & he told me about an idea he had that at the time I thought was impossible. Well today is the day, The Kickstarter for the completely revolutionized tripod is here and I am psyched. I have been keeping my lips sealed for the last few months & I’m so stoked to finally share what I have been using the last few months.
Get to know @peakdesign ‘s completely rebuilt from the ground up tripod in my bio link.

What I love most about Festivus is the great speech we wrote for Jerry Stiller telling the story and they’ve done a beautiful job laying it out graphically.
I still remember quite well how we wrote it.
Like any good piece of comedy there is not one wasted word and a lot of story is compressed into just a few sentences.
My favorites are:
“I went to buy a doll for my son”
and
“As I rained blows upon him”
So informative of the strange relationship George and his Father seemed to have. Affectionate yet explosive at any moment.
Anyway, love that even in 2018, ""Festivus rolls on..” Thanks to Dan O’Keefe and Happy Festivus everybody!"

370	370	1	a	I recently travelled to London & Copenhagen bringing only the @CanonUSA #EOSRP and the Canon RF 24-105mm f4 L IS USM lens with me. This was the perfect travel combo for exploring a new place without having to carry a backpack full of gear. Here’s a few images from my travels abroad 🤘🏻#ad #TeamCanon

377	377	1	a	#ad Looking back on a weekend well spent. Road tripping along the Oregon coast with the new @CanonUSA EOS RP allowed me to pack light without sacrificing image quality.

Niki and Carole took time from their busy ass schedule at @nnakarestaurant to design the food in #AlwaysBeMyMaybe ❤️ This photo is from our meeting where Niki and Carole first busted out pictures and descriptions of the monochrome plate, the headphones dish and everything else you see in that double date Maximal restaurant scene with Keanu.

418	418	1	a	#tbt Our incomparable script supervisor Kristin Rapinchuk, me and the queen Nahnatchka Khan. I love them both so much. Almost as much as I love the Costco coupon book. Introducing my 11-year-old niece to them on set was so important to me. I wanted my niece to see all of these powerful women working behind the camera, so she could know all the possibility that there is for her in this world. Now when she thinks of a film director, the picture in her mind, will be of Nahnatchka Khan. #AlwaysBeMyMaybe
419	419	1	a	Some advice: collaborate with people you absolutely adore and admire. It’s been a wild journey old friend. I can’t wait for everyone to witness your incredible and hilarious performance. They’ve seen you before, but never like this. #AlwaysBeMyMaybe is on Netflix tomorrow!!!

424	424	0	a	"The damage plastics are doing to our oceans is unbelievable. Just last month, scientists discovered a plastic bag on the floor of the deepest part of the ocean. And we’re seeing whales, dolphins and seagulls die with a stomach full of plastic.
The ocean isn’t our garbage dump. We need it to live, to breathe, to survive. So do marine animals. Let’s cut out the plastic, recycle and reuse what we can, and do our part to keep the oceans clean.@undp #worldoceansday"

446	446	1	a	@letterman’s newest season has a lot of fantastic guests, but for me, there’s one clear standout: @melindafrenchgates. I got to make a short cameo in Melinda’s episode. Letterman pitched a few crazy ideas for Microsoft and convinced me to try a sandwich with Worcestershire sauce and peanut butter (which I regret). Check it out on @netflix.
447	447	1	a	Summer is my favorite season to carve out extra time for reading. If you’re already starting to think about your summer reading list, here are five terrific books I’ve read so far this year. #bookstagram
448	448	0	a	Everyone at the @gatesfoundation looks forward to days when our trustee Warren is on campus. @melindafrenchgates and I couldn’t ask for a better champion for our employees, partners, and grantees. It was great to laugh and learn with him at our annual employee meeting.
449	449	1	a	I was touched when Melinda decided to write about my mother and my grandmother in her new book, The #MomentofLift. They were both tremendous role models for my sisters and me. I will always be grateful to my mom for instilling in us a love of reading and learning early on. Happy #MothersDay to all of the mothers out there -- and especially to my children’s role model, @melindafrenchgates.
450	450	0	a	For Teacher Appreciation Day, I’m thrilled to celebrate Washington State Teacher of the Year, Robert Hand. He recently showed me how cutting up a chicken is an important life skill (stay tuned for a video about that later this year). Which teacher has made the biggest impact on your life? ‪#ThankATeacher
451	451	0	a	Microbiologist Peter Piot was just 27 years old when the lab where he was working received a blood sample infected with a then-unknown disease. That virus is now known as Ebola and Peter was part of the team that helped discover it. I’ve spent a lot of time with Peter over the years, and I never get tired of hearing him talk about the case that made him famous.

454	454	1	a	@melindafrenchgates’s new book is out today. Melinda writes that one of the most important things she has learned in her work is that you must “let your heart break; it’s the price of being present to someone who is suffering.” Your heart will break more than once when you read this book. But more often, you will be enlightened and inspired. I know I certainly was! #MomentofLift

(My hosts gave me a blangkon — a traditional Javanese headdress — to wear for the visit.) If you’re as curious about mosquito-borne diseases as I am, I’ve put a link in my bio to help you explore some of the fascinating science behind these diseases (and what we’re learning about how to stop them). #MosquitoWeek

457	457	1	a	I would say this even if I weren’t married to the author: @melindafrenchgates’ new book The #MomentofLift is a terrific read. Melinda combines her mastery of data with her ability to tell powerful stories about the women who have impacted her life. I’m confident you’ll finish the book feeling enlightened and inspired. Download a free excerpt using the link in my bio.
458	458	0	a	India has more than 135 million goats – one-sixth of the world’s goat population -- and most of them are managed by women. That’s why I’m excited about the potential of a program called Project Mesha. Women are being trained to provide veterinary services to goats, which gives them a source of income and increases their independence. Although this project is still relatively small, it has the potential to make a huge impact for poor women and their families.
459	459	0	a	@stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence brings together experts from disciplines ranging from economics to ethics to understand how AI can improve life around the world. I really enjoyed being a part of the launch on Monday.
460	460	1	a	Tomorrow is International Women's Day — a day when we celebrate the progress made by and for women. To celebrate, @melindafrenchgates is sharing a chapter from her new book, “The Moment of Lift,” about the lessons she’s learned from women around the world (link in bio).
461	461	0	a	North-Grand High School was once ranked among the worst schools in Chicago. Today, it’s among the best. That’s because North-Grand and the Network for College Success began working together to increase the number of freshmen who finish the year on-track. Just seven years later, 95 percent of its freshman are on-track to graduate (up from 76 percent).
462	462	0	a	One of the most surprising experiences for me last year was participating in a discussion group with a bunch of teenage boys at a high school in Chicago. Although some of the guys talked about typical teenage frustrations—a teacher was treating them unfairly, or they kept dying in a video game—others had tragic stories. One had just watched a family member go to jail. Another spoke about a friend who had been shot. It was inspiring to see these young men working on dealing with their anger much earlier than I did. I was touched by the respect they had for each other and the intimacy they allowed themselves. I left thinking: This is how every classroom in the world should feel.

465	465	0	a	In our 2019 Annual Letter (link in bio), we wrote about the things that have surprised us over the years. Some worry us. Others inspire us. All of them are moving us to action. We hope they do the same for you, because that’s how the world gets better.
466	466	0	a	Wherever I am in the world, I always love talking with students. I was inspired by the energy of the community at Queen Mary University of London.
467	467	1	a	I recently visited @harvard to learn more about robotics research. I saw some surprising inventions that challenge what we think of as robots. I wore one robot like a glove. Another you could pull on like a pair of pants. These incredible creations are powerful examples of the exciting innovation underway in the field of robotics. You can read more about them on my blog (link in bio).

473	473	1	a	Amazon #reMARS is all about bringing the best and brightest together, so it’s fitting that I got to meet Leo — one of the first 100 recipients of the #AmazonFutureEngineer scholarship. I have no doubt Leo is going to be an inventor of tomorrow.
474	474	0	a	Grateful on this #MemorialDay to the fallen servicemen and women — and their families — for the ultimate sacrifice they made in defending and supporting our nation. The flag in the picture is on display on the factory wall at @BlueOrigin to remind us every day.
475	475	1	a	Great annual shareholder meeting today. #Amazon
476	476	0	a	Thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, I got the chance to meet Elijah and his family today. Elijah has a type of muscular dystrophy called Duchenne, and he’s been working to help find a cure. Elijah’s optimistic nature is one of his stand out characteristics, and it’s inspiring. Thanks for all the time today, @elijahjstacy!
477	477	0	a	My dad’s journey to the U.S. shows how people come together to help each other. We got a chance to celebrate him last night for the opening of the Statue of Liberty’s new museum. This is his story.
478	478	1	a	At the Statue of Liberty, where my dad’s being honored with a Liberty Star as part of the new museum’s opening. When he came here from Cuba at the age of 16, not only was he all alone, but he only spoke Spanish. His grit, determination, and optimism are inspiring. #StatueofLibertyMuseum

483	483	1	a	"We launched the Bezos Day One Fund with a commitment of $2 billion and focus on two areas: funding existing non-profits that help homeless families (Day 1 Families Fund), and creating a network of new, non-profit tier-one preschools in low-income communities (Day 1 Academies). Last fall we made the first Families Fund donations to 24 organizations across 16 states totaling $97.5 million.

Thanks to Mike George, who started his role as president in January, we’re also making good progress on Day 1 Academies, applying a beginners mind as we lay the foundation. Mike has met dozens of leaders in early childhood education, including Ray Girn of Higher Ground, Sara Cotner of Montessori For All, Richard Barth of KIPP, Mira Debs at Yale, Sep Kamvar at the Wildflower Schools, Angeline Lillard from the University of Virginia, and Catherine McTamaney from Vanderbilt, just to name a few (and a big thank you to these folks – and countless others – for their wisdom and passion!). Mike’s also spending time observing and learning at Montessori pre-schools. Yesterday he was in Austin at Magnolia Montessori for All. Also, we’ve started our search for key positions, including Head of Education, Head of Technology, and others (link in bio). Excited by the progress and the team of missionaries that will join us to create education opportunities for many thousands of children in underserved communities."

487	487	1	a	A perfect day. New Shepard has now racked up 10 consecutive successful launches, 9 consecutive successful booster landings, 3 consecutive successful escape tests, and 11 consecutive successful crew capsule landings (including a pad escape). Today’s mission was the 4th flight of this particular tail number -- all with minimal refurbishment between flights. Step by step, we’re getting close to human flight. And all of this learning is being incorporated into New Glenn too. I did wear my lucky boots today, but I’m pretty sure it’s actually the incredible @BlueOrigin team. #GradatimFerociter #NeverGetsOld

This weekend I’ll have the privilege of being honored by MTV for the ICON GENERATION AWARD.
Shaking my head as I’m watching this kid talk about his long term goals in Hollywood, WWE and beyond.
In 2001 there was no “Hollywood blueprint” for a guy like me — a 6’5, 275lb half Samoan/ half Black pro wrestler with absurdly waxed eyebrows (Jesus Christ 🤦🏽‍♂️) with a southern accent.
I was and still am, a walking contradiction who was willing to open my mind like a sponge to learn, put in the hard work, take the big risks and eventually I figured out that the most powerful thing I could ever be to Hollywood and the world - is myself.
Regardless of the road you’re all on, be YOU and if a blueprint for your goals doesn’t exist - fuck it - create your own.
And for the love of all things cool, dudes please don’t wax your eyebrows like I did.

Raising the bar for season 5 for our @HBO’s BALLERS.
And on a personal irony note ~ it’s been quite humbling shooting these scenes amongst NFL teams because for years my #1 real life goal was to play in the NFL.
I failed and that dream never came true.
But over the years I realized that playing in the NFL was the best thing that NEVER HAPPENED for me because after I failed (and after a fun battle with depression 🤪) it created a relentless drive that defines who I am today.

This bludgeoning will be in the film, but unfortunately the scene where I bite the bad guy’s eye out and spit it on the dirt didn’t make it.
MPAA ratings board forbid us to show it because it was too violent.
True story.
Plus, anytime you see a Samoan in a fight wearing their Lava Lava (traditional fabric I’m wearing around my waist) you know the other person is getting fucked up 🤣

My ace, @vanessa__kirby.
For HOBBS & SHAW it was important to me that our female lead was the central driving force within our storyline.
Also crucial she had a sharp wit and bad ass skill set (MI6 operative) that rivaled the male characters in our movie.
Strong female characters are always important to me in anything I produce — and with HOBBS & SHAW we flipped the script and raised the bar for our females and the entire FAST & FURIOUS franchise.

A chapter that started as just a dream from a kid from Boatrock. A dream that became a reality with the blessings of God Almighty ,hard work, the dedication to not give up and a village of prayer warriors surrounding me.
I stand tall & proud as I announce,  that this beautiful life changing ride that I have been on in the National Football League has come to an end, I’m officially hanging my cleats up, with no regrets!
How can I not be proud, 13 years in the game man, hell, I sometimes can’t believe it, but its real. I will forever be grateful for having the opportunity to do what I love for so many years, we climbed through the mud to get here , we broke barriers , we cried,  we laughed , we broke cycles , we broke records, we fell, but got the fuck back up, we lost some & double down and won the rest, we did what they said couldn’t be done, and I say we because with my family, my supporters, & my Almighty , we built this chapter of the story together.
I will forever love this game, and it’s a blessing to know the game loved me, real shit. I appreciate & thank everyone who played a role in my career. Every organization & coach I was blessed to play for, I am forever grateful for the opportunity’s & memories. My teammates , my brothers, I thank you, we had a fucking ball.  It was a honor to take the field with you all, we left our stain out there together. To every coach that played a part in molding me into the athlete that I am, you’ll never be forgotten. Coach Allen, Coach Gibby, Coach Fisher, Zim, Hugh, PG it was a honor to play for some of the best to do it.
Primetime thank you for your love & knowledge brother, Jerry Jones thank you for teaching me the business side of this game, Dave my brother you know what it is for life.
Coach Lewis &  Mr.Brown there will never be enough words to express how much love I got for you guys. Each of you, got to know the real me, you allowed me to be me , on my good days & bad, you had my back. You all showed me and my family, that love & loyalty does exist in this business ,"

As I enter my 4th World Cup and reflect briefly on my journey, I could not have made it this far without my close family and friends as well as others who have supported me from day 1. It has not been an easy journey by any means but it’s taught me a lot. It’s taught me to fight and never give up. I’ve become a better wife, friend, sibling and person and eventually will instill those values in our future kids.
To my husband you have been my world. You have always believed in me. You have never complained once and have always encouraged me to best player and person I can be. I can’t thank you enough for all of your support through the ups and downs. I love you more than anything in the world and know you will be with me every step of the way.

Thank you to my family, my friends and ones who have been there from the start. I don’t often say it enough but you are part of this amazing journey. You are the ones I am playing for to end this last chapter. I love you all."

I knew she was my spirit animal when I told her I thought the best way to meet new people was just to walk up to them laughing and that's how we awkwardly met Meryl Streep. We all need a best friend who'll walk up to strangers fake laughing with us. 😉 (And a special thanks to Amy Adams for being so cool in this moment and introducing us to Meryl Streep even though I'm sure she thought we were tipsy. But no... just dorks.)

670	670	0	a	As we commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day, I'm thinking about all the young troops who faced down impossible odds that day – some of whom I actually got to meet on my own visits to Normandy. I’m also thinking about my grandfather. Though Gramps arrived at Omaha Beach weeks after D-Day, I remember how much I missed him during my visit five years ago – I wanted to have him right there with me, to hear his stories, to share the experience. But I was lucky to spend time with “Rock” Merritt who, as a younger man, saw a recruitment poster asking him if he was man enough to be a paratrooper — and signed up on the spot. All these years later, Rock is best-known not just for his exploits on D-Day, or for his decades in uniform, but for the time he’s spent speaking to the young men and women of today’s Army. Five years ago today, at Omaha Beach – democracy’s beachhead – I spoke about the debt we owe Rock and his fellow veterans who risked and gave their lives in defense of democracy.
671	671	0	a	On Friday, I had a chance to meet with some inspiring young leaders from around the world who were in Ottawa last week for the Open Government Partnership Global Summit. From Kyrgyzstan to Argentina, we're seeing a new generation taking the reins to empower others and harness new technologies for smarter, better government. It's inspiring—the kind of thing that will create a better world for all of us.

677	677	0	a	"Today is Holocaust Remembrance Day. It’s easy, on a day like this, to reflect at something of a distance. The photos are grainy now, dusty artifacts from another era. It was a different world then, we can tell ourselves—another place, another time.
Fully grappling with the reality of the Holocaust, though, isn’t so simple. Because before the camps and the brownshirts, before the consolidation of political power, before millions of lives were extinguished, there were simply people, not altogether different from any of us, who chose to see their neighbors as different, as other, as something less.
It’s a sadly familiar choice, one that we’ve seen generation after generation. And today, in our world of encroaching division and calcifying bubbles, we’ve seen once again the swiftness with which that choice—that failure to recognize ourselves in one another—can accelerate into violence.
So it’s up to us to make a different choice—to choose empathy over apathy; to sow seeds of hope rather than hate; to embrace our shared humanity, no matter how we worship, what we look like, who we love, or where our families came from.
That’s how we can not only pause to remember a tragedy once a year, but act on the lessons we’ve learned from it every day."
678	678	1	a	Today, we welcome the next 20 civic leaders as @ObamaFoundation Fellows. In every region of the world, these folks are already leading the way—instilling hope in disadvantaged communities, championing restorative justice, even growing food in the desert. Congratulations to the new class of Fellows. I'm excited to see the connections they'll make—and the lives they'll change. Obama.org/fellowship
679	679	0	a	One hundred years ago, Nelson Mandela was born, and 25 years ago, his country held its first democratic elections. It was a true honor to mark these anniversaries by sitting with his wife, Graça Machel, to discuss Mandela's legacy of justice, opportunity, and peace—and the call for all of us to carry it on, especially young people like Lesley Williams, one of our @ObamaFoundation African Leaders. As we confront division, discrimination, inequality in our own time—challenges too big for one person and too complex for one simple solution—it's easy to get discouraged. I find that it's best then, as it often is, to remind ourselves of the words of a political prisoner who rose to lead a nation and inspire the world. Because as he said: “It always seems impossible until it is done.”
680	680	0	a	To all who celebrate today, happy Easter from our family to yours! On this day of rebirth and renewal, let’s recommit to love and serve our brothers and sisters, especially those in need, in every way we can. Have a great day, everybody.
681	681	0	a	Back in 2008, I joined a few staffers for an impromptu Passover Seder on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania — Manischewitz, matzo, and all — and we kept it going during my time in the White House. It was a chance to pause, to connect around a shared meal, and to tell the Exodus story, which reminds us of faith’s triumph over oppression and calls on us to stand with those still yearning for freedom and opportunity today. I hope everyone gathering for a Seder tonight has a blessed and meaningful Passover.
682	682	0	a	Notre Dame is one of the world’s great treasures, and we’re thinking of the people of France in your time of grief. It’s in our nature to mourn when we see history lost – but it’s also in our nature to rebuild for tomorrow, as strong as we can.
683	683	0	a	No matter what country we’re in, connecting young people with more tools, more resources, more attention, and maybe a little bit of inspiration is the best investment we can make in the future. And when these young people work together and learn from each other, their work will change the world. That’s what I saw in the hundreds of young leaders from across Europe and it’s what the @ObamaFoundation is all about.
684	684	1	a	Valerie is one of my oldest friends and a lifelong advisor – she was by my side when I first decided to run for office and for every major moment of the presidency. I’ve always been proud of Valerie and her extraordinary work to advocate for women, improve the lives of working families, and promote equality for all — but more than the policies she helped shape, I am proud of how she did the work. While Valerie was discovering her own sense of belonging, she was out there making sure other women knew they also deserved to be heard. “Finding My Voice” offers a rare look inside the presidency and a window into the life of a public servant who is dedicated to improving the lives of others. @ValerieBJarrett’s voice has often inspired me and I know her memoir will inspire others to lift their voices, too.

686	686	0	a	This was back in 2011, when I was visiting the tiny town of Moneygall, the place where my great-great-great grandfather, a shoemaker named Falmouth Kearney, lived his early life. I marveled as I walked around on the same old floorboards that he did, then I had the privilege to address the people of Ireland on College Green. For me, this photo pretty much sums up their joyful spirit; a warmth and generosity that stay with me to this day. Happy St. Patrick's Day—on this day, it’ll always be O’Bama.

689	689	0	a	“As a phrase, ‘My Brother’s Keeper’ continues to keep me focused—especially when I lose hope or get weary. When I repeat it to myself, I’m reminded of all the young people whose lives I might have impacted and those who I have yet to impact. It reinvigorates me, causes me to get up, and reminds me that the work isn’t over yet. I am My Brother’s Keeper. “My hope for all boys and young men of color is peace. I hope for a brighter future where these young men won’t be fearful of applying for a job or chasing an opportunity because of their skin color. Too often I hear my peers talk about how they have to go about things a certain way or there are certain jobs they simply cannot do. “I just want to grow. I want to expand. #MBKRising gives us a chance to come together as a community and have the conversations that can only come from a diversity of perspectives. I am only one person with one set of experiences. There’s a limit to what I know. The only way I’ll be able to grow and learn is to interact with the community of leaders who are working hard to help boys and young men of color like me achieve their dreams. That’s when we all learn.” —Jerron Hawkins, 21, participant at #MBKRising, Washington D.C. (3/3)
690	690	0	a	“My friends and I started a program to mentor students at the elementary school next door. We helped each other keep the good work going. When I got to Howard I hit the ground running—joining student organizations, getting an internship at the White House during the Obama administration, and becoming a mentee as part of the My Brother’s Keeper initiative, where I had the chance to meet President Obama, ask him for advice, and share what was going on in my life. “Since beginning my mentorship program five years ago, I’ve found a passion for combating disparities and inequalities I see. My mission is to change the world one community at a time. I recently founded my own nonprofit to help out other college students, providing scholarships and highlighting the achievement and impact of minority students across the U.S. ” —Jerron Hawkins, 21, participant at #MBKRising, Washington D.C. (2/3)
691	691	0	a	"Meet Jerron Hawkins. He’s a young man I got to know when he was a White House mentee in 2014, and he’s one of the hundreds of people coming to Oakland this week for MBK Rising!, a nationwide gathering of community members and partners that represent the My Brother’s Keeper movement. We’re bringing these groups together to celebrate five years of progress on behalf of boys and young men of color—and to set our sights on the road ahead.
Since we started My Brother’s Keeper five years ago, one of the things we’ve seen consistently is the power of mentoring as a tool to help young people address the challenges they face and see the opportunities in front of them. Mentoring just works.
Today, I’m turning my Instagram account over to Jerron to tell you a little about his experience with mentorship. His story shows us what’s possible when we invest in our young people and show them we believe in their promise. It’s the kind of story we should hear more often—the kind we’ll hear a lot of in Oakland this week. It’s the kind story that gives me hope. “At the beginning of high school, I felt like I wasn’t operating with purpose. I wasn’t helping anyone. I was selected to be a member of my principal’s student leadership team and I thought ‘Why me? I don’t see myself like this.’ But in senior year, I found AMATE—African American Males Aspiring to Excel—a mentoring program for young men of color. What was so powerful to me about the group was the vulnerability. As guys, we were used to not talking about our problems. We bottled it all up and called it pride. So to be in this group of young men, sharing their feelings and being vulnerable with each other, was life-changing for me.”—Jerron Hawkins, 21, participant at #MBKRising, Washington D.C. (1/3)"
692	692	1	a	"Five years ago, I launched the My Brother’s Keeper initiative calling on all Americans to take action on behalf our nation’s boys and young men of color. It was a call to make sure every child felt valued, safe, and supported by their community—a call to help these young men in particular see hope and opportunity in their future.

We’ve come a long way in those five years. Today, as part of the @ObamaFoundation, the @MBK_Alliance consists of nearly 250 communities working to break down barriers that too often leave boys and young men of color at a disadvantage. And tomorrow in Oakland, I’ll join the My Brother’s Keeper community to mark the progress we’ve made and chart the course ahead at a celebration we’re calling MBK Rising!

In the lead-up to the event, and in honor of Black History Month, I wanted to share a nonfiction reading list that can help to provide some essential context about the challenges that many people of color face every day. From modern memoirs to cornerstones of the American narrative, these works can help us better understand our country’s past and our evolving, persistent struggles with race—and they can be fuel on our journey toward a more fair and just future for all of our sons and daughters. They certainly are for me.

I hope you’ll take some time to read some of these books, letters, and articles. And tomorrow, I hope you’ll follow along with MBK Rising! at Obama.org/mbka.

Like humans, dry & chapped skin is more prone to injury from splitting and cracking. Healthy, moisturized paws are flexible and actually allow for dogs to get a better grip. You can heal & mend dry paws FAST and SAFELY with all-natural #PawSoother from @naturaldogcompany. Works much better & faster than coconut oil!

The King of Spain and The King of the Netherlands will also attend this year’s Garter Day, during which they were installed in St. George’s Chapel as Supernumerary, or ‘Stranger’, Knights of the Garter.
The Garter Day tradition dates back over 700 years when, in medieval times, King Edward III was inspired by tales of King Arthur and the chivalry of the Knights of the Round Table that he set up his own group of honourable knights, called the Order of the Garter.
The Knights are chosen from a variety of backgrounds, in recognition for public service.
Today, the Order includes the Queen, who is Sovereign of the Garter, several senior Members of the Royal Family including the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge, and twenty-four knights chosen in recognition of their work.
St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle has been the spiritual home of the Order since its foundation.
In the Quire of the Chapel are brass stall plates recording the Order’s membership through the centuries. 📷1 shows King George V and Queen Mary at Garter Day,
📷 2 shows The Queen, then Princess Elizabeth in 1948,

The Duchess of Cornwall, The Duchess of Cambridge and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex along with Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank, The Earl and Countess of Wessex and their children, are also in attendance at Trooping the Colour.

792	792	1	a	Haven’t posted a dish that I’ve made in a while because I’ve been busy prepping for @tasteoftacoma next week where we’ll be doing live cooking demos and a mystery ingredient cook-off with amazing local chefs! I am so excited and honored to be the youngest chef ever on Taste of Tacoma! Here is a dessert I recently made: Wine stewed cherries with sugared almonds, fresh mint, and whipped mascarpone! It’s cherry delicious! 😋 #puns #representpnw #masterchefjunior #season7 #farmtotable #goodfood #foodie #feministfoodie #teamsadie #sadieeatsseattle #feminist #cheffin #kidscancook #girlscancook #littlebutfierce #campmasterchef #pnwcuisine #silverspoon #cheffinitup #semifinals #top6 #gardenfresh #freshherbs #cherries #summerdessert
793	793	0	a	Today marks the date that one of my biggest culinary heros passed, exactly 1 year ago: Anthony Bourdain. He was such an inspiration to me as well as millions of people worldwide. One of his inspirational quotes is as follows: “You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.” When he left this world, we all lost a piece of our hearts, a hole that will never again be filled. But what he left behind was his legacy. And, this legacy will inspire today’s chef as well as tomorrow’s. #InOurHeartsForever

I am honored to have been part of your 35 year journey as a chef in Kitashinchi, Osaka.
Congratulations for holding your star for over ten years, the relationships you’ve created with guests, vendors, etc. but most importantly to all the chefs you’ve created.
My favorite conversation is when you told me about your philosophy on dreams and goals. “Only 1% of dreams come true, so why not dream and work towards a million goals so you always have a purpose.” To the next chapter.. 35年間お疲れ様です！

983	983	1	a	I remember being blown away in this moment on the @avengers set. Nobody was allowed to film anything on their phones. I said screw it. No rule was going to stop me from seizing this once in a lifetime opportunity to capture this collection of stars, a groupthat likely will never be in the same room again. We are so blessed.
984	984	0	a	RIP “Magnus” Our magnificent gentle Tamworth giant fell ill and passed away two days ago. This was a hard one. He was as cuddly as a 700lb boar could be. We’ll miss him. He had the biggest nuts of any mammal I’d ever seen in person. I’ll miss seeing those bowling ball size testicles waggle to and fro as he rooted for hazelnuts in the hay. #farmlife 😢🙏♥️✝️

999	999	0	a	After 19 year of this amazing sport I am hanging up my leo for the last time. It’s been a rollercoaster of a journey and I couldn’t have done it without the love and support of my family, team and coaches. Gymnastics has taught me grit, passion, preservation, time management and many other life skills I will be able to take with me through life. Through all the road blocks, injuries and tough practices I knew I could always rely on my support system to get me through it. Competing my senior year with a torn meniscus, there were many ups and downs this season but being able to end on some of my best performances ever shows that with perseverance and determination anything is possible. Thank you to my coaches and teammates for believing in me and pushing me to not only be a better gymnast but also a better person. Thank you to my family for always supporting me and cheering me on throughout my career. I wouldn’t be where I am today without you! Go Dawgs💜

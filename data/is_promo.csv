Alright y’all, here it is!! My Dapper Day look 2019!! 😆💖 I mean can we just talk for a moment about what a fashion ICON Miss Piggy is?! 🐽 She OWNS the stage & never shies away from being her true self 🙌🏻 Growing up, I always LOVED the Muppets, especially Muppet Treasure Island 🌴 Miss Piggy can fight for herself and doesn’t care what anyone else thinks of her, which makes her a true QUEEN 👑

I hope everyone had a lovely weekend! This spring weather in Florida has been EVERYTHING 🌷I was so happy it was finally nice enough to wear these adorable Bambi tights @fundotcom_ sent me! 💕

I actually wore this over-the-top outfit (I know I’m on level 💯 here, but that’s why I love it 😅) to the auto repair shop this weekend and I’m absolutely positive everyone thought I was crazy lol 😂🙃 (I mean, they’re not wrong). What was even funnier was watching me climb into my car from the passenger side in a giant tutu and getting caught in the door 🤣🤣🤣 (If you missed my story this past weekend, a tree fell on my car and broke the drivers side door handle off 🙄🌳) .

But ya know, I was dressing for my Spring Epcot theme, and I just thought the auto shop would like to see a bit of that magic too 🌸💗😜🥰","2,068 likes",/BwkjbPXFSyT/,1,abbycorkins

Not only did they accomplish their mission but they documented the process, the good, the bad, the hilarious, and the heavy. The objective was to survive the hectic journey, but what they found was an even deeper awareness of who they are- which is the best part of any adventure. My good friend and director Kellen Keene are seeking to share it all with us through their film.

This weekend I’ll have the privilege of being honored by MTV for the ICON GENERATION AWARD.
Shaking my head as I’m watching this kid talk about his long term goals in Hollywood, WWE and beyond.
In 2001 there was no “Hollywood blueprint” for a guy like me — a 6’5, 275lb half Samoan/ half Black pro wrestler with absurdly waxed eyebrows (Jesus Christ 🤦🏽‍♂️) with a southern accent.
I was and still am, a walking contradiction who was willing to open my mind like a sponge to learn, put in the hard work, take the big risks and eventually I figured out that the most powerful thing I could ever be to Hollywood and the world - is myself.
Regardless of the road you’re all on, be YOU and if a blueprint for your goals doesn’t exist - fuck it - create your own.
And for the love of all things cool, dudes please don’t wax your eyebrows like I did.

This bludgeoning will be in the film, but unfortunately the scene where I bite the bad guy’s eye out and spit it on the dirt didn’t make it.
MPAA ratings board forbid us to show it because it was too violent.
True story.
Plus, anytime you see a Samoan in a fight wearing their Lava Lava (traditional fabric I’m wearing around my waist) you know the other person is getting fucked up 🤣

My ace, @vanessa__kirby.
For HOBBS & SHAW it was important to me that our female lead was the central driving force within our storyline.
Also crucial she had a sharp wit and bad ass skill set (MI6 operative) that rivaled the male characters in our movie.
Strong female characters are always important to me in anything I produce — and with HOBBS & SHAW we flipped the script and raised the bar for our females and the entire FAST & FURIOUS franchise.
Allow me to reintroduce HER.

As I enter my 4th World Cup and reflect briefly on my journey, I could not have made it this far without my close family and friends as well as others who have supported me from day 1. It has not been an easy journey by any means but it’s taught me a lot. It’s taught me to fight and never give up. I’ve become a better wife, friend, sibling and person and eventually will instill those values in our future kids.
To my husband you have been my world. You have always believed in me. You have never complained once and have always encouraged me to best player and person I can be. I can’t thank you enough for all of your support through the ups and downs. I love you more than anything in the world and know you will be with me every step of the way.

Thank you to my family, my friends and ones who have been there from the start. I don’t often say it enough but you are part of this amazing journey. You are the ones I am playing for to end this last chapter. I love you all.","121,781",/ByaN9dWDzkA/,1,carlilloyd

692,692,FEBRUARY 18,"Five years ago, I launched the My Brother’s Keeper initiative calling on all Americans to take action on behalf our nation’s boys and young men of color. It was a call to make sure every child felt valued, safe, and supported by their community—a call to help these young men in particular see hope and opportunity in their future.

We’ve come a long way in those five years. Today, as part of the @ObamaFoundation, the @MBK_Alliance consists of nearly 250 communities working to break down barriers that too often leave boys and young men of color at a disadvantage. And tomorrow in Oakland, I’ll join the My Brother’s Keeper community to mark the progress we’ve made and chart the course ahead at a celebration we’re calling MBK Rising!

In the lead-up to the event, and in honor of Black History Month, I wanted to share a nonfiction reading list that can help to provide some essential context about the challenges that many people of color face every day. From modern memoirs to cornerstones of the American narrative, these works can help us better understand our country’s past and our evolving, persistent struggles with race—and they can be fuel on our journey toward a more fair and just future for all of our sons and daughters. They certainly are for me.

I hope you’ll take some time to read some of these books, letters, and articles. And tomorrow, I hope you’ll follow along with MBK Rising! at Obama.org/mbka.

Made in Sport is a new campaign that will bring together around 60 charities already working in sports to raise funds and empower grassroots clubs in the most disadvantaged communities across the UK.

The Duke met British Boxers @anthony_joshua and @nicolaadamsobe who were taking young people through a boxing training session – and who have also lent their support to the new campaign.

Working on control & extensions which is tough for me. I’ve always LOVED dis choreo & the dancers who created it (aka the beasts Delaney & CJ) so decided to learn dis from an insta vid while back home in Dallas 💛 tbh being in my hometown always reconnects me to why I love my craft so much. Just work hard & focus on your growth. The rest is just noise. 🤙🏼","1,967",/Bw9yG14Auvt/,1,tanya_thanawa

SF was lit 🔥 It was my first time out there & I loved it. Even tho I was so scared of flying cross country (if u know me, then u know I have bad claustrophobia), being able to travel & teach is an absolute dream.

Not too get too emotional here, but I remember how hard it was growing up not knowing anyone else like me. Anyone else who was attracted to both genders. I thought there was something wrong with me. I didn’t even know that being bisexual was a thing. I spent a lot of years refusing to even open up to the possibility of love because it scared me so incredibly much. It took me 23 years to understand and accept myself. And now I am truly the happiest I have EVER been with the best partner I have ever had in my whole entire life 💝 Life can be scary for those who are trying to figure out their sexuality, so let’s have the BEST Pride month ever & celebrate all of the wonderful members of this LGBTQ+ community and the allies who support us!! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈","4,876 likes",/ByLbW4lFOVB/,0,abbycorkins

Flashbacks from the most perfect night ⛅️ Taylor and I spent the eventing at Studios (my favorite) before waking over to the Boardwalk to grab some Ample Hills ice cream 🍦. After that we went and took some pictures inside the photo booth because it’s honestly one of my favorite things to do! I have so many strips of pictures from different fun park times with friends! Each one reminds me of a day when we would squish inside a very hot booth with no air circulation to pose like goofs 😆😅 Also there’s just something about having the pictures physically printed out 📷 (if you use your magic band, digital copies like these will also sync to your app so you can save them on your phone too!) 💓 If you haven’t done these photo booths in the parks before (or also on the Boardwalk), I HIGHLY recommend it!! .

Also can we appreciate how ADORABLE Taylor is?! 😍 Like gosh dang, how did I ever get so lucky?!💕 🍀🥰","2,410 likes",/BxgDn1hFQb1/,0,abbycorkins

Here’s the juicy stuff: so this past weekend, @thepixietraveler and I had breakfast at Trattoria al Forno on the Boardwalk 😋 (right around the corner from this picture! Sorry I forgot to Story it! 🙈). It’s honestly one of my FAVORITE breakfasts on property 🥚🥞 And here’s a little tip if you want to go there, but you a) aren’t interested in character dining or b) want to save some $. If you go up to the desk there, you can actually ask to sit in a small room off to the side that is separate from the rest of the dining room. The characters don’t come in that room & you can order off of a menu a la cart! So it’s MUCH cheaper!! 🎉 Also bonus is you don’t have to make a reservation for this! (Though it can get full from time to time, but I’ve honestly never had to wait too long) And the BEST part is their Iced Coffee, which is topped with whipped cream & is sooo sweet and delicious!! ☕️🤤 (the coffee is honestly my favorite part of this whole place) So there ya go!! 🙌🏻 A little insider tip on how to save some money & also have some of the best coffee of your life!! 😉😘💖","3,131 likes",/BwW_VdTl6BN/,0,abbycorkins
171,171,18 HOURS AGO,"This experience they call Fatherhood has been the greatest gift I could have ever been given. I still remember being 25 years old.. coming home from my first trip to Japan where I shot a cover story for Surfer magazine and I was buzzing with excitement. I came home to my wife @brea_face who announced by holding up a onesie .. that we were pregnant. I don’t even remember the words that came out of my mouth but I’m sure they were some type of supportive mumble. But the truth was I was scared sh*tless, trembling and more afraid then I’ve ever been. I’ve dealt with my fair share of insecurity as a young dad raising two boys.. the added pressure of not growing up with my Father made me question myself In many ways. I would say that for me personally there has been nothing that has provided more growth more healing and pride than raising these two with my amazing wife @brea_face .","52,722 likes",/Byyxt5DlRp_/,0,chrisburkard

Transparency is everything.... and in a concerted effort to be more transparent I have been working this year to take physical & mental stock of my toll on the environment. Which is why I am working in 2019 to create an Environmental Advocacy Document that is available to the public on my website listing the many Environmental Partners we have supported & continue to work with Including NGO’s & Social Justice groups over the last 10 years. As well as measure my carbon footprint.
This document also includes efforts made both personally & through my business that have helped define what we (my team & I) stand for. Decisions like running our entire office off of solar, being a certified Green business by the county of San Luis Obispo or personal choices like eating vegan or having a veggie garden. Every decision makes a difference, even the small ones.
I do this not for bragging rights but to hopefully set a better example of transparency in a day and age where so many of us make our living and livelihood from nature. I hope others will do the same.
A few of the Environmental Advocacy groups we have been lucky to work with are:

This happens so often in life as well. You can go to great lengths to have a perfect day.. amazing breakfast, favorite music, exercise.. whatever - And the first person to cut you off in traffic steals your attention and your “happiness”. Just something to think about as you go about your day looking for positive, rather than negative.

I still remember quite well how we wrote it.
Like any good piece of comedy there is not one wasted word and a lot of story is compressed into just a few sentences.
My favorites are:
“I went to buy a doll for my son”
and
“As I rained blows upon him”
So informative of the strange relationship George and his Father seemed to have. Affectionate yet explosive at any moment.

670,670,JUNE 6,"As we commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day, I'm thinking about all the young troops who faced down impossible odds that day – some of whom I actually got to meet on my own visits to Normandy. I’m also thinking about my grandfather. Though Gramps arrived at Omaha Beach weeks after D-Day, I remember how much I missed him during my visit five years ago – I wanted to have him right there with me, to hear his stories, to share the experience. But I was lucky to spend time with “Rock” Merritt who, as a younger man, saw a recruitment poster asking him if he was man enough to be a paratrooper — and signed up on the spot. All these years later, Rock is best-known not just for his exploits on D-Day, or for his decades in uniform, but for the time he’s spent speaking to the young men and women of today’s Army. Five years ago today, at Omaha Beach – democracy’s beachhead – I spoke about the debt we owe Rock and his fellow veterans who risked and gave their lives in defense of democracy.","776,348 likes",/ByXyZCHAEWh/,0,barackobama

677,677,MAY 2,"Today is Holocaust Remembrance Day. It’s easy, on a day like this, to reflect at something of a distance. The photos are grainy now, dusty artifacts from another era. It was a different world then, we can tell ourselves—another place, another time.
Fully grappling with the reality of the Holocaust, though, isn’t so simple. Because before the camps and the brownshirts, before the consolidation of political power, before millions of lives were extinguished, there were simply people, not altogether different from any of us, who chose to see their neighbors as different, as other, as something less.
It’s a sadly familiar choice, one that we’ve seen generation after generation. And today, in our world of encroaching division and calcifying bubbles, we’ve seen once again the swiftness with which that choice—that failure to recognize ourselves in one another—can accelerate into violence.
So it’s up to us to make a different choice—to choose empathy over apathy; to sow seeds of hope rather than hate; to embrace our shared humanity, no matter how we worship, what we look like, who we love, or where our families came from.
That’s how we can not only pause to remember a tragedy once a year, but act on the lessons we’ve learned from it every day.","443,594 likes",/Bw-KXk4Ad7L/,0,barackobama

He’s a young man I got to know when he was a White House mentee in 2014, and he’s one of the hundreds of people coming to Oakland this week for MBK Rising!, a nationwide gathering of community members and partners that represent the My Brother’s Keeper movement. We’re bringing these groups together to celebrate five years of progress on behalf of boys and young men of color—and to set our sights on the road ahead.
Since we started My Brother’s Keeper five years ago, one of the things we’ve seen consistently is the power of mentoring as a tool to help young people address the challenges they face and see the opportunities in front of them. Mentoring just works.
Today, I’m turning my Instagram account over to Jerron to tell you a little about his experience with mentorship. His story shows us what’s possible when we invest in our young people and show them we believe in their promise. It’s the kind of story we should hear more often—the kind we’ll hear a lot of in Oakland this week. It’s the kind story that gives me hope. “At the beginning of high school, I felt like I wasn’t operating with purpose. I wasn’t helping anyone. I was selected to be a member of my principal’s student leadership team and I thought ‘Why me? I don’t see myself like this.’ But in senior year, I found AMATE—African American Males Aspiring to Excel—a mentoring program for young men of color. What was so powerful to me about the group was the vulnerability. As guys, we were used to not talking about our problems. We bottled it all up and called it pride. So to be in this group of young men, sharing their feelings and being vulnerable with each other, was life-changing for me.”—Jerron Hawkins, 21, participant at #MBKRising, Washington D.C.

The Garter Day tradition dates back over 700 years when, in medieval times, King Edward III was inspired by tales of King Arthur and the chivalry of the Knights of the Round Table that he set up his own group of honourable knights, called the Order of the Garter.
The Knights are chosen from a variety of backgrounds, in recognition for public service.
Today, the Order includes the Queen, who is Sovereign of the Garter, several senior Members of the Royal Family including the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge, and twenty-four knights chosen in recognition of their work.
St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle has been the spiritual home of the Order since its foundation.
In the Quire of the Chapel are brass stall plates recording the Order’s membership through the centuries. 📷1 shows King George V and Queen Mary at Garter Day,

The Colour of the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards is being trooped at #QBP2019. The colours (flags) of the battalion are carried (or 'trooped') down the ranks.

The Queen’s actual birthday is 21 April but is officially celebrated in June with #TroopingtheColour, which has marked the official birthday of the British Sovereign for over 260 years.

The Queen travels down The Mall from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade.

It is the 69th time The Queen has attended Trooping the Colour- a great display of military precision, horsemanship and fanfare.

Royal Colonels: The Prince of Wales (Welsh Guards), The Duke of Cambridge (Irish Guards), The Duke of York (Grenadier Guards) and The Princess Royal (The Blues and Royals) accompanied Her Majesty on horseback, along with The Duke of Kent, Royal Colonel of (Scots Guards) #QBP2019.

The Duchess of Cornwall, The Duchess of Cambridge and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex along with Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank, The Earl and Countess of Wessex and their children, are also in attendance at Trooping the Colour.

One of his inspirational quotes is as follows: “You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.” When he left this world, we all lost a piece of our hearts, a hole that will never again be filled. But what he left behind was his legacy.

999,999,APRIL 7,"After 19 year of this amazing sport I am hanging up my leo for the last time. It’s been a rollercoaster of a journey and I couldn’t have done it without the love and support of my family, team and coaches. Gymnastics has taught me grit, passion, preservation, time management and many other life skills I will be able to take with me through life. Through all the road blocks, injuries and tough practices I knew I could always rely on my support system to get me through it. Competing my senior year with a torn meniscus, there were many ups and downs this season but being able to end on some of my best performances ever shows that with perseverance and determination anything is possible. Thank you to my coaches and teammates for believing in me and pushing me to not only be a better gymnast but also a better person. Thank you to my family for always supporting me and cheering me on throughout my career. I wouldn’t be where I am today without you! Go Dawgs💜",259 likes,/Bv-gHttnt2f/,0,maloryrose

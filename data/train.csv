125,1023,1,B,"‪Appreciate the veterans who joined me for a discussion in Sumter as they continue serving by advocating for those who they served alongside. We're going to fully invest in veteran resources and their education, job training, housing, mental and physical health care, and earned benefits. That's a promise this country must keep, and under my administration, we will.‬"
126,1028,0,B,"‪Grateful for the powerful discussion in North Charleston this morning about fixing a justice system that is patently unjust. We are committed to continuing the urgent work necessary to secure equity, opportunity, justice, and full civil rights for everyone in this country."
127,1035,1,B,‪We will #FightFor15 and we will win.‬
128,1034,0,B,"‪Today and every single day, I’m standing strong with workers in South Carolina and across the country to #fightfor15, to fight for a minimum wage that is a living wage, to fight for the right to organize at a time when unions are under attack, and to fight for an economy that works for all.‬"
129,1036,0,B,"‪While visiting the Gullah Geechee Nation and hearing about their proud tradition of fierce independence, I saw where the Harriet Tubman Monument will be built and learned about Robert Smalls, who took possession of a confederate ship to bring more people freedom and to ensure justice at risk to his own life. Too often we see these heroic stories written out of our curriculum and written out of our history."
130,1027,0,B,"‪Grateful for the opportunity to meet with, listen to, and learn from citizens of the Gullah Geechee Nation during tonight’s town hall. Thank you for welcoming us and instructing us in the history and traditions that inspire not just this country but people beyond our shores.‬"

133,400,1,B,"I unveiled a robust plan today to protect LGBTQ+ rights and finally secure comprehensive legal protection for members of the LGBTQ+ community. The proposal would leverage executive power and call for congressional action that ensures that LGBTQ+ people have full equality and opportunity. Our plan not only includes actions to immediately reverse the Trump Administration’s discriminatory policies, but also calls for action to ensure equal treatment for LGBTQ+ individuals. Additionally, the plan prioritizes America’s role in protecting LGBTQ+ people around the globe. Full details in link."
134,1033,0,B,‪Thank you to everyone who joined us on a run to the LGBT Memorial this morning as we celebrate Pride Month and commit to the work ahead so we can ensure there is full civil rights and full equality in this country.‬
135,812,0,B,"Three years after Pulse, we honor the 49 lives that were senselessly taken with our actions. With a commitment to ending violence against LGBTQ+ Americans. With a commitment to fighting discrimination. And with a commitment to securing full equality. That’s why I just released a new plan that would ensure LGBTQ+ Americans can live openly without fear of discrimination or violence and would immediately reverse the Trump Administration’s discriminatory policies."
136,882,0,B,"We’re showing up everywhere, talking to everyone, and building a grassroots campaign from the ground up. Last weekend in Iowa, we met with farmers and local leaders, got to hear from Iowans at four town halls, joined the Capital City Pride fest, and opened our Linn County organizing office. We’re building momentum in Iowa, and we’re not slowing down."
137,1029,0,B,"‪I don’t listen to the NRA or the gun lobby. I listen to people, and they’ve made it clear we need universal background checks without exception, to stop selling weapons of war into our communities, to implement red flag laws, and to fully fund research on ending gun violence.‬"
138,632,0,B,Peggy told me that this was the first town hall she had ever been to. Very grateful that she joined us this morning.

140,1022,0,B,"‪An energizing day at the Iowa Democratic Party Hall of Fame. So many incredible candidates, local leaders, organizers, and volunteers all coming together and fighting alongside one another to ensure that we not only defeat Trump but that we also overcome the greatest set of challenges this country has ever faced.‬ I’m confident that by working together, we are up to the task ahead of us."
141,171,0,B,Deeply grateful for the opportunity to join Pastor Whitfield and the congregation of Mt. Carmel Baptist Church this morning. A beautiful service and a reminder of the power and joy that we can bring forth when we come together to meet the challenges we face.‬
142,1021,0,B,‪Amy and I started the morning at Morg’s Diner for breakfast with Rep. Ras Smith. Really great to hear about his leadership in the Waterloo community and his work in education to close the achievement gap while implementing dropout prevention services.‬
143,1025,0,B,"‪Getting to meet some of the volunteers in Linn County who are knocking on doors, organizing their community, and bringing more people into this campaign and our democracy.‬"

I didn’t even know that being bisexual was a thing. I spent a lot of years refusing to even open up to the possibility of love because it scared me so incredibly much. It took me 23 years to understand and accept myself.

Flashbacks from the most perfect night ⛅️ Taylor and I spent the eventing at Studios (my favorite) before waking over to the Boardwalk to grab some Ample Hills ice cream 🍦. After that we went and took some pictures inside the photo booth because it’s honestly one of my favorite things to do! I have so many strips of pictures from different fun park times with friends! Each one reminds me of a day when we would squish inside a very hot booth with no air circulation to pose like goofs 😆😅 Also there’s just something about having the pictures physically printed out 📷 (if you use your magic band, digital copies like these will also sync to your app so you can save them on your phone too!) 💓 If you haven’t done these photo booths in the parks before (or also on the Boardwalk), I HIGHLY recommend it!! .

Here’s the juicy stuff: so this past weekend, @thepixietraveler and I had breakfast at Trattoria al Forno on the Boardwalk 😋 (right around the corner from this picture! Sorry I forgot to Story it! 🙈). It’s honestly one of my FAVORITE breakfasts on property 🥚🥞 And here’s a little tip if you want to go there, but you a) aren’t interested in character dining or b) want to save some $. If you go up to the desk there, you can actually ask to sit in a small room off to the side that is separate from the rest of the dining room. The characters don’t come in that room & you can order off of a menu a la cart! So it’s MUCH cheaper!! 🎉 Also bonus is you don’t have to make a reservation for this! (Though it can get full from time to time, but I’ve honestly never had to wait too long) And the BEST part is their Iced Coffee, which is topped with whipped cream & is sooo sweet and delicious!! ☕️🤤 (the coffee is honestly my favorite part of this whole place) So there ya go!! 🙌🏻 A little insider tip on how to save some money & also have some of the best coffee of your life!! 😉😘💖"

I came home to my wife @brea_face who announced by holding up a onesie .. that we were pregnant. I don’t even remember the words that came out of my mouth but I’m sure they were some type of supportive mumble. But the truth was I was scared sh*tless, trembling and more afraid then I’ve ever been. I’ve dealt with my fair share of insecurity as a young dad raising two boys.. the added pressure of not growing up with my Father made me question myself In many ways.

Transparency is everything.... and in a concerted effort to be more transparent I have been working this year to take physical & mental stock of my toll on the environment.

As well as measure my carbon footprint.
This document also includes efforts made both personally & through my business that have helped define what we (my team & I) stand for. Decisions like running our entire office off of solar, being a certified Green business by the county of San Luis Obispo or personal choices like eating vegan or having a veggie garden. Every decision makes a difference, even the small ones.
I do this not for bragging rights but to hopefully set a better example of transparency in a day and age where so many of us make our living and livelihood from nature. I hope others will do the same.

191,364,1,B,"I didn’t even think it was physically possible, when the Higginbotham brothers @byhandproject told me they were going to prone paddle from Alaska to Mexico...unassisted, virtually unsupported, no corporate sponsors, just each other and a goal. Not only did they accomplish their mission but they documented the process, the good, the bad, the hilarious, and the heavy. The objective was to survive the hectic journey, but what they found was an even deeper awareness of who they are- which is the best part of any adventure. My good friend and director Kellen Keene are seeking to share it all with us through their film.
.
Their film is almost finished and needs a final push from people that still believe in good old fashioned storytelling. Check it out at @byhandproject and learn how you can help out!"
192,627,0,B,"Our happiness is so cheap. What I mean by that is that despite the often overwhelming waves of praise we seek out we tend to focus on the one negative thing. Social media is a great example .. when you share something near and dear to your heart, possibly even opening up about something personal- instead of seeing all the good, we tend to hone in on just the negative comments or those that may not agree.. as if everyone is supposed to? This happens so often in life as well. You can go to great lengths to have a perfect day.. amazing breakfast, favorite music, exercise.. whatever - And the first person to cut you off in traffic steals your attention and your “happiness”. Just something to think about as you go about your day looking for positive, rather than negative.

194,142,1,B,"Can tripods be better? I have always had a love/ hate relationship with tripods. Two years ago I sat with my friend Peter discussing all the issues I I found with the bulky modern day design & he told me about an idea he had that at the time I thought was impossible. Well today is the day, The Kickstarter for the completely revolutionized tripod is here and I am psyched. I have been keeping my lips sealed for the last few months & I’m so stoked to finally share what I have been using the last few months.

What I love most about Festivus is the great speech we wrote for Jerry Stiller telling the story and they’ve done a beautiful job laying it out graphically.
I still remember quite well how we wrote it.
Like any good piece of comedy there is not one wasted word and a lot of story is compressed into just a few sentences.
My favorites are:
“I went to buy a doll for my son”
and
“As I rained blows upon him”
So informative of the strange relationship George and his Father seemed to have. Affectionate yet explosive at any moment.
Anyway, love that even in 2018, ""Festivus rolls on..” Thanks to Dan O’Keefe and Happy Festivus everybody!"

Introducing my 11-year-old niece to them on set was so important to me. I wanted my niece to see all of these powerful women working behind the camera, so she could know all the possibility that there is for her in this world.

424,763,0,B,"The damage plastics are doing to our oceans is unbelievable. Just last month, scientists discovered a plastic bag on the floor of the deepest part of the ocean. And we’re seeing whales, dolphins and seagulls die with a stomach full of plastic.

446,54,1,B,"@letterman’s newest season has a lot of fantastic guests, but for me, there’s one clear standout: @melindafrenchgates. I got to make a short cameo in Melinda’s episode.

Melinda writes that one of the most important things she has learned in her work is that you must “let your heart break; it’s the price of being present to someone who is suffering.” Your heart will break more than once when you read this book.

Download a free excerpt using the link in my bio.
458,422,0,B,"India has more than 135 million goats – one-sixth of the world’s goat population -- and most of them are managed by women. That’s why I’m excited about the potential of a program called Project Mesha. Women are being trained to provide veterinary services to goats, which gives them a source of income and increases their independence. Although this project is still relatively small, it has the potential to make a huge impact for poor women and their families."

461,593,0,B,"North-Grand High School was once ranked among the worst schools in Chicago. Today, it’s among the best. That’s because North-Grand and the Network for College Success began working together to increase the number of freshmen who finish the year on-track. Just seven years later, 95 percent of its freshman are on-track to graduate (up from 76 percent)."
462,616,0,B,"One of the most surprising experiences for me last year was participating in a discussion group with a bunch of teenage boys at a high school in Chicago. Although some of the guys talked about typical teenage frustrations—a teacher was treating them unfairly, or they kept dying in a video game—others had tragic stories. One had just watched a family member go to jail. Another spoke about a friend who had been shot. It was inspiring to see these young men working on dealing with their anger much earlier than I did. I was touched by the respect they had for each other and the intimacy they allowed themselves. I left thinking: This is how every classroom in the world should feel."
463,17,0,B,#TBT to that time I traveled halfway across the world to look at a toilet.
464,777,0,B,"The world keeps getting older, but Africa stays the same age. It sounds confusing, but it makes sense when you break it down."

467,394,1,B,I recently visited @harvard to learn more about robotics research. I saw some surprising inventions that challenge what we think of as robots. I wore one robot like a glove. Another you could pull on like a pair of pants. These incredible creations are powerful examples of the exciting innovation underway in the field of robotics. You can read more about them on my blog (link in bio).

478,108,1,B,"At the Statue of Liberty, where my dad’s being honored with a Liberty Star as part of the new museum’s opening.

483,869,1,B,"We launched the Bezos Day One Fund with a commitment of $2 billion and focus on two areas: funding existing non-profits that help homeless families (Day 1 Families Fund), and creating a network of new, non-profit tier-one preschools in low-income communities (Day 1 Academies). Last fall we made the first Families Fund donations to 24 organizations across 16 states totaling $97.5 million.

Thanks to Mike George, who started his role as president in January, we’re also making good progress on Day 1 Academies, applying a beginners mind as we lay the foundation. Mike has met dozens of leaders in early childhood education, including Ray Girn of Higher Ground, Sara Cotner of Montessori For All, Richard Barth of KIPP, Mira Debs at Yale, Sep Kamvar at the Wildflower Schools, Angeline Lillard from the University of Virginia, and Catherine McTamaney from Vanderbilt, just to name a few (and a big thank you to these folks – and countless others – for their wisdom and passion!). Mike’s also spending time observing and learning at Montessori pre-schools. Yesterday he was in Austin at Magnolia Montessori for All. Also, we’ve started our search for key positions, including Head of Education, Head of Technology, and others (link in bio). Excited by the progress and the team of missionaries that will join us to create education opportunities for many thousands of children in underserved communities."

New Shepard has now racked up 10 consecutive successful launches, 9 consecutive successful booster landings, 3 consecutive successful escape tests, and 11 consecutive successful crew capsule landings (including a pad escape). Today’s mission was the 4th flight of this particular tail number -- all with minimal refurbishment between flights. Step by step, we’re getting close to human flight. And all of this learning is being incorporated into New Glenn too.

This weekend I’ll have the privilege of being honored by MTV for the ICON GENERATION AWARD.
Shaking my head as I’m watching this kid talk about his long term goals in Hollywood, WWE and beyond.
In 2001 there was no “Hollywood blueprint” for a guy like me — a 6’5, 275lb half Samoan/ half Black pro wrestler with absurdly waxed eyebrows (Jesus Christ 🤦🏽‍♂️) with a southern accent.
I was and still am, a walking contradiction who was willing to open my mind like a sponge to learn, put in the hard work, take the big risks and eventually I figured out that the most powerful thing I could ever be to Hollywood and the world - is myself.
Regardless of the road you’re all on, be YOU and if a blueprint for your goals doesn’t exist - fuck it - create your own.
And for the love of all things cool, dudes please don’t wax your eyebrows like I did.

I failed and that dream never came true.
But over the years I realized that playing in the NFL was the best thing that NEVER HAPPENED for me because after I failed (and after a fun battle with depression 🤪) it created a relentless drive that defines who I am today.

MPAA ratings board forbid us to show it because it was too violent.

My ace, @vanessa__kirby.
For HOBBS & SHAW it was important to me that our female lead was the central driving force within our storyline.
Also crucial she had a sharp wit and bad ass skill set (MI6 operative) that rivaled the male characters in our movie.
Strong female characters are always important to me in anything I produce — and with HOBBS & SHAW we flipped the script and raised the bar for our females and the entire FAST & FURIOUS franchise.

I will forever be grateful for having the opportunity to do what I love for so many years, we climbed through the mud to get here , we broke barriers , we cried,  we laughed , we broke cycles , we broke records, we fell, but got the fuck back up, we lost some & double down and won the rest, we did what they said couldn’t be done, and I say we because with my family, my supporters, & my Almighty , we built this chapter of the story together.
I will forever love this game, and it’s a blessing to know the game loved me, real shit. I appreciate & thank everyone who played a role in my career. Every organization & coach I was blessed to play for, I am forever grateful for the opportunity’s & memories. My teammates , my brothers, I thank you, we had a fucking ball.

It has not been an easy journey by any means but it’s taught me a lot. It’s taught me to fight and never give up. I’ve become a better wife, friend, sibling and person and eventually will instill those values in our future kids.
To my husband you have been my world. You have always believed in me. You have never complained once and have always encouraged me to best player and person I can be. I can’t thank you enough for all of your support through the ups and downs. I love you more than anything in the world and know you will be with me every step of the way.

670,105,0,B,"As we commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day, I'm thinking about all the young troops who faced down impossible odds that day – some of whom I actually got to meet on my own visits to Normandy. I’m also thinking about my grandfather. Though Gramps arrived at Omaha Beach weeks after D-Day, I remember how much I missed him during my visit five years ago – I wanted to have him right there with me, to hear his stories, to share the experience. But I was lucky to spend time with “Rock” Merritt who, as a younger man, saw a recruitment poster asking him if he was man enough to be a paratrooper — and signed up on the spot. All these years later, Rock is best-known not just for his exploits on D-Day, or for his decades in uniform, but for the time he’s spent speaking to the young men and women of today’s Army. Five years ago today, at Omaha Beach – democracy’s beachhead – I spoke about the debt we owe Rock and his fellow veterans who risked and gave their lives in defense of democracy."
671,609,0,B,"On Friday, I had a chance to meet with some inspiring young leaders from around the world who were in Ottawa last week for the Open Government Partnership Global Summit.

677,825,0,B,"Today is Holocaust Remembrance Day. It’s easy, on a day like this, to reflect at something of a distance. The photos are grainy now, dusty artifacts from another era. It was a different world then, we can tell ourselves—another place, another time.
Fully grappling with the reality of the Holocaust, though, isn’t so simple. Because before the camps and the brownshirts, before the consolidation of political power, before millions of lives were extinguished, there were simply people, not altogether different from any of us, who chose to see their neighbors as different, as other, as something less.
It’s a sadly familiar choice, one that we’ve seen generation after generation. And today, in our world of encroaching division and calcifying bubbles, we’ve seen once again the swiftness with which that choice—that failure to recognize ourselves in one another—can accelerate into violence.
So it’s up to us to make a different choice—to choose empathy over apathy; to sow seeds of hope rather than hate; to embrace our shared humanity, no matter how we worship, what we look like, who we love, or where our families came from.
That’s how we can not only pause to remember a tragedy once a year, but act on the lessons we’ve learned from it every day."
678,836,1,B,"Today, we welcome the next 20 civic leaders as @ObamaFoundation Fellows. In every region of the world, these folks are already leading the way—instilling hope in disadvantaged communities, championing restorative justice, even growing food in the desert. Congratulations to the new class of Fellows. I'm excited to see the connections they'll make—and the lives they'll change. Obama.org/fellowship"
679,613,0,B,"One hundred years ago, Nelson Mandela was born, and 25 years ago, his country held its first democratic elections. It was a true honor to mark these anniversaries by sitting with his wife, Graça Machel, to discuss Mandela's legacy of justice, opportunity, and peace—and the call for all of us to carry it on, especially young people like Lesley Williams, one of our @ObamaFoundation African Leaders. As we confront division, discrimination, inequality in our own time—challenges too big for one person and too complex for one simple solution—it's easy to get discouraged. I find that it's best then, as it often is, to remind ourselves of the words of a political prisoner who rose to lead a nation and inspire the world. Because as he said: “It always seems impossible until it is done.”"
680,819,0,B,"To all who celebrate today, happy Easter from our family to yours! On this day of rebirth and renewal, let’s recommit to love and serve our brothers and sisters, especially those in need, in every way we can. Have a great day, everybody."
681,118,0,B,"Back in 2008, I joined a few staffers for an impromptu Passover Seder on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania — Manischewitz, matzo, and all — and we kept it going during my time in the White House. It was a chance to pause, to connect around a shared meal, and to tell the Exodus story, which reminds us of faith’s triumph over oppression and calls on us to stand with those still yearning for freedom and opportunity today. I hope everyone gathering for a Seder tonight has a blessed and meaningful Passover."
682,596,0,B,"Notre Dame is one of the world’s great treasures, and we’re thinking of the people of France in your time of grief. It’s in our nature to mourn when we see history lost – but it’s also in our nature to rebuild for tomorrow, as strong as we can."
683,591,0,B,"No matter what country we’re in, connecting young people with more tools, more resources, more attention, and maybe a little bit of inspiration is the best investment we can make in the future. And when these young people work together and learn from each other, their work will change the world. That’s what I saw in the hundreds of young leaders from across Europe and it’s what the @ObamaFoundation is all about."
684,855,1,B,"Valerie is one of my oldest friends and a lifelong advisor – she was by my side when I first decided to run for office and for every major moment of the presidency. I’ve always been proud of Valerie and her extraordinary work to advocate for women, improve the lives of working families, and promote equality for all — but more than the policies she helped shape, I am proud of how she did the work. While Valerie was discovering her own sense of belonging, she was out there making sure other women knew they also deserved to be heard. “Finding My Voice” offers a rare look inside the presidency and a window into the life of a public servant who is dedicated to improving the lives of others. @ValerieBJarrett’s voice has often inspired me and I know her memoir will inspire others to lift their voices, too."
685,468,1,B,"Just in the nick of time: My brackets have never been my one shining moment, but here we go again. You can check out my #MarchMadness picks at Obama.org."
686,807,0,B,"This was back in 2011, when I was visiting the tiny town of Moneygall, the place where my great-great-great grandfather, a shoemaker named Falmouth Kearney, lived his early life. I marveled as I walked around on the same old floorboards that he did, then I had the privilege to address the people of Ireland on College Green. For me, this photo pretty much sums up their joyful spirit; a warmth and generosity that stay with me to this day. Happy St. Patrick's Day—on this day, it’ll always be O’Bama."
687,535,0,B,"Michelle and I send condolences and strength to the people of New Zealand. We grieve with you and with the Muslim community. Every single one of us, every color, every creed, has a daily responsibility to rally against hate and bigotry in all their forms and to stand up for what is good, and decent, and true."
688,443,1,B,It’s up to all of us as citizens to make sure that the rules of democracy are fair—everywhere—because the next decade of our nation's progress is on the line. Join me and @allontheline in the fight against gerrymandering. Join the team today: allontheline.org
689,1000,0,B,"“As a phrase, ‘My Brother’s Keeper’ continues to keep me focused—especially when I lose hope or get weary. When I repeat it to myself, I’m reminded of all the young people whose lives I might have impacted and those who I have yet to impact. It reinvigorates me, causes me to get up, and reminds me that the work isn’t over yet. I am My Brother’s Keeper. “My hope for all boys and young men of color is peace. I hope for a brighter future where these young men won’t be fearful of applying for a job or chasing an opportunity because of their skin color. Too often I hear my peers talk about how they have to go about things a certain way or there are certain jobs they simply cannot do. “I just want to grow. I want to expand. #MBKRising gives us a chance to come together as a community and have the conversations that can only come from a diversity of perspectives. I am only one person with one set of experiences. There’s a limit to what I know. The only way I’ll be able to grow and learn is to interact with the community of leaders who are working hard to help boys and young men of color like me achieve their dreams. That’s when we all learn.” —Jerron Hawkins, 21, participant at #MBKRising, Washington D.C. (3/3)"
690,1010,0,B,"“My friends and I started a program to mentor students at the elementary school next door. We helped each other keep the good work going. When I got to Howard I hit the ground running—joining student organizations, getting an internship at the White House during the Obama administration, and becoming a mentee as part of the My Brother’s Keeper initiative, where I had the chance to meet President Obama, ask him for advice, and share what was going on in my life. “Since beginning my mentorship program five years ago, I’ve found a passion for combating disparities and inequalities I see. My mission is to change the world one community at a time. I recently founded my own nonprofit to help out other college students, providing scholarships and highlighting the achievement and impact of minority students across the U.S. ” —Jerron Hawkins, 21, participant at #MBKRising, Washington D.C. (2/3)"
691,529,0,B,"Meet Jerron Hawkins. He’s a young man I got to know when he was a White House mentee in 2014, and he’s one of the hundreds of people coming to Oakland this week for MBK Rising!, a nationwide gathering of community members and partners that represent the My Brother’s Keeper movement. We’re bringing these groups together to celebrate five years of progress on behalf of boys and young men of color—and to set our sights on the road ahead.
Since we started My Brother’s Keeper five years ago, one of the things we’ve seen consistently is the power of mentoring as a tool to help young people address the challenges they face and see the opportunities in front of them. Mentoring just works.
Today, I’m turning my Instagram account over to Jerron to tell you a little about his experience with mentorship. His story shows us what’s possible when we invest in our young people and show them we believe in their promise. It’s the kind of story we should hear more often—the kind we’ll hear a lot of in Oakland this week. It’s the kind story that gives me hope. “At the beginning of high school, I felt like I wasn’t operating with purpose. I wasn’t helping anyone. I was selected to be a member of my principal’s student leadership team and I thought ‘Why me? I don’t see myself like this.’ But in senior year, I found AMATE—African American Males Aspiring to Excel—a mentoring program for young men of color. What was so powerful to me about the group was the vulnerability. As guys, we were used to not talking about our problems. We bottled it all up and called it pride. So to be in this group of young men, sharing their feelings and being vulnerable with each other, was life-changing for me.”—Jerron Hawkins, 21, participant at #MBKRising, Washington D.C. (1/3)"
692,220,1,B,"Five years ago, I launched the My Brother’s Keeper initiative calling on all Americans to take action on behalf our nation’s boys and young men of color. It was a call to make sure every child felt valued, safe, and supported by their community—a call to help these young men in particular see hope and opportunity in their future.

We’ve come a long way in those five years. Today, as part of the @ObamaFoundation, the @MBK_Alliance consists of nearly 250 communities working to break down barriers that too often leave boys and young men of color at a disadvantage. And tomorrow in Oakland, I’ll join the My Brother’s Keeper community to mark the progress we’ve made and chart the course ahead at a celebration we’re calling MBK Rising!

In the lead-up to the event, and in honor of Black History Month, I wanted to share a nonfiction reading list that can help to provide some essential context about the challenges that many people of color face every day. From modern memoirs to cornerstones of the American narrative, these works can help us better understand our country’s past and our evolving, persistent struggles with race—and they can be fuel on our journey toward a more fair and just future for all of our sons and daughters. They certainly are for me.

I hope you’ll take some time to read some of these books, letters, and articles. And tomorrow, I hope you’ll follow along with MBK Rising! at Obama.org/mbka.

Like humans, dry & chapped skin is more prone to injury from splitting and cracking. Healthy, moisturized paws are flexible and actually allow for dogs to get a better grip. You can heal & mend dry paws FAST and SAFELY with all-natural #PawSoother from @naturaldogcompany. Works much better & faster than coconut oil!

The Garter Day tradition dates back over 700 years when, in medieval times, King Edward III was inspired by tales of King Arthur and the chivalry of the Knights of the Round Table that he set up his own group of honourable knights, called the Order of the Garter.
The Knights are chosen from a variety of backgrounds, in recognition for public service.
Today, the Order includes the Queen, who is Sovereign of the Garter, several senior Members of the Royal Family including the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge, and twenty-four knights chosen in recognition of their work.
St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle has been the spiritual home of the Order since its foundation.
In the Quire of the Chapel are brass stall plates recording the Order’s membership through the centuries. 📷1 shows King George V and Queen Mary at Garter Day,

793,828,0,B,"Today marks the date that one of my biggest culinary heros passed, exactly 1 year ago: Anthony Bourdain. He was such an inspiration to me as well as millions of people worldwide. One of his inspirational quotes is as follows: “You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.” When he left this world, we all lost a piece of our hearts, a hole that will never again be filled. But what he left behind was his legacy. And, this legacy will inspire today’s chef as well as tomorrow’s. #InOurHeartsForever"

983,395,1,B,"I remember being blown away in this moment on the @avengers set. Nobody was allowed to film anything on their phones. I said screw it. No rule was going to stop me from seizing this once in a lifetime opportunity to capture this collection of stars, a groupthat likely will never be in the same room again. We are so blessed."
984,650,0,B,RIP “Magnus” Our magnificent gentle Tamworth giant fell ill and passed away two days ago. This was a hard one. He was as cuddly as a 700lb boar could be. We’ll miss him. He had the biggest nuts of any mammal I’d ever seen in person. I’ll miss seeing those bowling ball size testicles waggle to and fro as he rooted for hazelnuts in the hay. #farmlife 😢🙏♥️✝️

998,475,0,B,Just when you thought I couldn’t change my routine again this year🙃 #seriesnumber5
999,82,0,B,"After 19 year of this amazing sport I am hanging up my leo for the last time. It’s been a rollercoaster of a journey and I couldn’t have done it without the love and support of my family, team and coaches. Gymnastics has taught me grit, passion, preservation, time management and many other life skills I will be able to take with me through life. Through all the road blocks, injuries and tough practices I knew I could always rely on my support system to get me through it. Competing my senior year with a torn meniscus, there were many ups and downs this season but being able to end on some of my best performances ever shows that with perseverance and determination anything is possible. Thank you to my coaches and teammates for believing in me and pushing me to not only be a better gymnast but also a better person. Thank you to my family for always supporting me and cheering me on throughout my career. I wouldn’t be where I am today without you! Go Dawgs💜"

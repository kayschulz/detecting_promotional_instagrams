What I’ve found is that I love fear because once I acknowledge it and push past it anyway, the rewards waiting on the other side make me want to chase after fear ten times over. Today, I’ve now coached hundreds of ambitious corporate professionals to do the same… scared of networking, scared of presenting, scared of trying… they too have been able to enjoy the rewards waiting for them on the other side... dream jobs, dream collaborations, dream opportunities, and dream salaries. All from just trying something new! #inspire #cultivateyourcareer',\n",

So proud to join the ranks of digital content moguls as the first trans woman to call her own creative shots at a major content company. “As a best-selling author, producer and director, Janet Mock has demonstrated she knows how to bring her vision to thrilling, vivid life,” says Cindy Holland, Netflix VP of original content. “She’s a groundbreaker and creative force who we think will fit right in here at Netflix.” My mentor, boss and friend @mrrpmurphy told @variety, “Upon my first meeting with Janet, I knew she was a star and had the stuff moguls are made of. Being able to watch her grow, first as a writer, then a producer and now an acclaimed director who’s helmed four episodes for my productions, has been a gift. I am honored to be her mentor and friend, am grateful she’ll be joining me to write and direct on ‘Hollywood,’ and am so excited to see what she creates at Netflix. Janet is a cultural force, and the world needs her stories.”\",\n",

       " (\"I'm excited to announce that I am partnering with @netflix to tell stories on a global platform. So proud to join the ranks of digital content moguls as the first trans woman to call her own creative shots at a major content company. “As a best-selling author, producer and director, Janet Mock has demonstrated she knows how to bring her vision to thrilling, vivid life,” says Cindy Holland, Netflix VP of original content. “She’s a groundbreaker and creative force who we think will fit right in here at Netflix.” My mentor, boss and friend @mrrpmurphy told @variety, “Upon my first meeting with Janet, I knew she was a star and had the stuff moguls are made of. Being able to watch her grow, first as a writer, then a producer and now an acclaimed director who’s helmed four episodes for my productions, has been a gift. I am honored to be her mentor and friend, am grateful she’ll be joining me to write and direct on ‘Hollywood,’ and am so excited to see what she creates at Netflix. Janet is a cultural force, and the world needs her stories.”\",\n",

We also make shit happen, too (from @leynabloom and @iamjarijones at Cannes and @indyamoore on ELLE and @mjrodriguez7 at the MTV Awards and @missmajor1 with House of GG and @soulfreedreams at @mpjinstitute and @tourmaliiine with @hbdmarsha and @fatfemme with Sephora and @wond3rwoman1 with NIKE and @theofficialtati with Equinox and @dominiquet.a.r.jackson on POSE) and are rarely given our flowers (or resources, or love, or care, or acknowledgement) when we are here and alive to smell them. Often times I feel we are yelling into the wind, yearning for folks fighting for black lives, women’s rights, gender justice, LGBTQ equality to hear our cries. I’m weary of reminding my siblings who live daily with the threat of violence looming that they are in danger by amplifying another fallen trans woman. We are familiar with fear and I yearn for us to become intimate with creating and living and loving. Maybe this post can inspire a few of y’all to become echoes, igniting vital change in your parts of the world. So you are aware: 10 trans women of color have been killed or reported dead in 2019, half of them in June (PRIDE MONTH), according to @outmagazine’s @raquel_willis.',\n",

Directing enables me to ensure that I am always centering myself and my communities in the stories I tell.

    "The model was evaluated on 248 unseen captions by unseen instagram users. The model had an accuracy of 70%. Admittedly, this is not the best accuracy, however, when we were hand labeling the data there was a lot of gray area in some of the captions. We also had some sampling bias as we used a very small proportion of instagram users.\n",
    "\n",
    "We explored the captions that were incorrectly classified and noticed some trends in the error. First, the most common type of error was to predict non-promotional when the post was promotional. One possible reason, is that there was slightly more non-promotional captions in our training data. A second related trend is that for long posts that were promotional, if the promotional material was at the end of the caption, it was harder to classify as promotional than if it was at the beginning of the caption. Third, there were some misclassified post that had the literal word \"ad\" in the caption. It is possible that this word did not show up much, if at all in the training data and therefore it did not learn that ad was promotional."
